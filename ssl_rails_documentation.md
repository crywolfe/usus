### Set Up the WEBrick SSL Server on LocalHost

Out of the box, Rails with WEBrick server does not provide an easy solution to build an SSL server using HTTPS for development purposes on localhost.

However, running an HTTPS WEBrick server on `https://localhost:3000` is not difficult and can be accomplished as described below.  

Insert the following code into the `config.ru` file located in the root of the Rails application.

WEBrick is a Rack-based server.  The `config.ru` file is used by Rack-based servers to start the application.

```
# The following code needs to be added to the very top of the config.ru file

require 'openssl' # Needed to implement the Secure Sockets Layer protocols.
require 'webrick' # Needed to configure WEBrick
require 'webrick/https' # Needed to configure WEBrick as an HTTPS server
```

Now that the contents of the openssl, webrick and HTTPS ruby files are available in this application, the application is ready to create the HTTPS server.  To do so, one needs to take two steps.
(1) enable SSL, and
(2) provide an SSL certificate name.

Both of those steps are accomplished by inserting the following code.  This code needs to be inserted below all the `require` lines.  This code implements the enabling of SSL and also provides the SSL certificate name.

```
Rack::Handler::WEBrick.run Rails.application, {
  SSLEnable: true,
  SSLPrivateKey: OpenSSL::PKey::RSA.new(
    File.open('certs/server.key').read
  ),
  SSLCertificate: OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.new(
    File.open('certs/server.crt').read
  )
}
```
Lastly, the `certs/server.key` and `certs/server.crt` files need to be created.  Both files refer to keys and certificates the developer creates on their local environments.

Create the certs directory inside the root directory of the application using the standard `mkdir certs` command.

Once a certs directory is created then run the following commands.
```
cd certs
ssh-keygen -f server.key
openssl req -new -key server.key -out request.csr
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in request.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt
```

Now that the three steps have been completed, it is time to start the HTTPS server.
Type `rails s`.

When done, the similar output to the output below should be expected.

```

```
If the above output shows up, a successful HTTPS server has been created.

###Stopping the Rails WEBrick SSL Server

Stopping the HTTPS server is not as simple as typing `ctrl-c`.  Shutting it down requires additional commands.

The first command is as follows:

`ps aux | grep ruby`

This chained command will provide an output similar to the following.
`$           2443   0.0  1.5  2578296 123204 s000  T     4:42PM   0:02.98 $/.rbenv/versions/2.1.0/bin/ruby bin/rails s`

The first number "2443" is called the process id number.  `kill -9 [PID]` will shutdown the server.

Since the PID is "2443" `kill -9 2443` will shut the server down.
